			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p><strong>Tom kha kai, tom kha gai</strong> or <strong>Thai coconut soup</strong> is a spicy and sour hot soup with coconut milk in Thai cuisine and Lao cuisine. <strong>tom kha gai</strong> is eaten more like a curry instead of a soup, paired with a plate of rice and spooned onto your rice before eating. Made of chicken (Gai) cooked (Tom) in coconut milk which has been infused with galangal (Kha), lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves, this soup is seasoned primarily with lime juice and fish sauce. Palm or coconut sugar is not necessary as the natural sweetness of coconut is enough.</p>

			<ol>
				<li class="directions" >First, heat up the stock. If using less flavoured stock, double the quantity and concentrate the stock before going on with the recipe. Put the chicken stock in a wide and shallow saucepan (to ensure fast evaporation), bring it to a boil, and reduce it over medium-high heat until the liquid measures half its original volume.</li>
				<li class="directions">Halve (or quarter) the straw mushrooms into bite-sized pieces; set aside.</li>
				<li class="directions">Cut the lemongrass stalk into 1-inch pieces and smash them with the side of a large Chinese cleaver, a pestle, or any heavy object lying around in the house; set aside.</li>
				<li class="directions">Do to the chilies what you just did to the lemongrass; set aside.</li>
				<li class="directions">Remove the stems and the tough veins that run through the middle from the kaffir lime leaves, and tear them up into small pieces. You can also bruise them a little. Set aside.</li>
				<li class="directions">Juice 2 limes; set aside. You may need more; you may not. It's better to have more than you need than not enough.</li>
				<li class="directions">Pour the coconut milk into over the concentrated chicken stock. Add the kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass pieces, and galangal slices.</li>
				<li class="directions">Bring the mixture slowly to between 160&deg; and 180&deg; F (slightly below a simmer), allowing the herbs to infuse the liquid for about a minute.</li>
				<li class="directions">Keeping the temperature steady, add the mushrooms and the chicken to the liquid; adjust the heat to maintain the temperature. The liquid should never at any point come to a rapid boil. Don't worry; at 160-180&deg; F, your chicken will be thoroughly cooked.</li>
				<li class="directions">Stir gently to ensure that the chicken is evenly cooked. </li>
				<li class="directions">Once the chicken is cooked through, throw in the smashed chilies and remove the pot from heat immediately.</li>
				<li class="directions">Add the juice of 2 limes and the fish sauce to the pot, stir, and taste. Add more lime juice and fish sauce, if necessary. The soup should be predominantly sour, followed by salty. The sweetness comes from natural sugar in the coconut milk.</li>
				<li class="directions">Stir in the cilantro leaves and serve your tom kha gai with steamed jasmine rice as an entree.</li>

			<h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>
			<p>If you have access to very, very good chicken bouillon granules which are not all about salt and very little flavor, by all means, dilute double the amount you normally use in water and use that in place of the concentrated chicken stock.</p>
			<p>You can also use white button, cremini, and oyster mushrooms. Any meaty, mild-flavored mushrooms will do. Portobello mushrooms are fine flavor- and texture-wise, but even with the gills carefully scraped off they still turn the broth into an unappetizing shade of gray. Do not use shiitake; the flavor is way too strong for this.</p>
			<p>Tom kha gai is such a simple yet marvelous tasting Thai dish, and it's sure to be a favorite when you make this recipe and serve it to friends and family.</p>
